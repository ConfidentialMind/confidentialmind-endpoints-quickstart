# QuickStart for ConfidentialMind AI Endpoints

This repository contains simple examples to help you get started with our AI services.

## What's Inside

This repository is organized into the following sections:

### Python Examples
- **Model Endpoint Examples** (`/model-endpoint`): Simple code snippets to interact with language models via API
- **RAG Endpoint Examples** (`/rag-endpoint`): Examples for using our Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to chat with your documents
- **Open WebUI Proxy** (`/open-webui`): A Flask-based proxy that allows you to connect Open WebUI to multiple ConfidentialMind model endpoints through a unified OpenAI-compatible interface

### TypeScript Examples
- **Model Endpoint Examples** (`/model-endpoint-ts`): TypeScript versions of the model endpoint examples
- **RAG Endpoint Examples** (`/rag-endpoint-ts`): TypeScript versions of the RAG endpoint examples

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to your preferred directory based on your programming language and use case:
   - Python: `model-endpoint`, `rag-endpoint`, or `open-webui`
   - TypeScript: `model-endpoint-ts` or `rag-endpoint-ts`
3. Follow the instructions in the respective README.md file

Each directory contains standalone examples that demonstrate core functionality with minimal dependencies.

## Endpoint Types & Open WebUI

- **Model Endpoint**: Direct access to our language models (similar to OpenAI's API)
- **RAG Endpoint**: Enhanced AI that can retrieve and reason over your documents (also compatible with OpenAI's API)
- **Open WebUI Proxy**: Enables the popular Open WebUI interface to connect to multiple ConfidentialMind endpoints, allowing you to select different models from a dropdown menu

## Prerequisites

- Python environment (for Python examples)
- Node.js and npm (for TypeScript examples)
- API access credentials (provided separately)
