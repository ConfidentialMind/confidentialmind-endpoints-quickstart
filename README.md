# QuickStart for ConfidentialMind AI Endpoints

This repository contains simple examples to help you get started with our AI services.

## What's Inside

This repository is organized into two main sections:

- **Model Endpoint Examples** (`/model-endpoint`): Simple code snippets to interact with language models via API
- **RAG Endpoint Examples** (`/rag-endpoint`): Examples for using our Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to chat with your documents

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to either the `model-endpoint` or `rag-endpoint` directory
3. Follow the instructions in the respective README.md file

Each directory contains standalone examples that demonstrate core functionality with minimal dependencies.

## Model Endpoint vs RAG Endpoint

- **Model Endpoint**: Direct access to our language models (similar to OpenAI's API)
- **RAG Endpoint**: Enhanced AI that can retrieve and reason over your documents (also compatible with OpenAI's API)

## Prerequisites

- Python environment
- API access credentials (provided separately)
